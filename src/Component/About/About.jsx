          These are the basic vaccination requirements which are given to a person in the different age groups to lead a normal life. However, the vaccines which are taken for the individual diseases are not counted in the list. It can be observed that a person can never remember about this kind of heavy vaccination schedule and that’s where the vaccination tracking apps show up. The vaccination tracking app reminds you about all your vaccinations, and makes sure you don’t miss the one.
